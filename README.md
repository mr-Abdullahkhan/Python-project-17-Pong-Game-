**🏓 Pong Game (Python)**
===

A classic Pong arcade game built using Python Turtle graphics, featuring two paddles, a bouncing ball, and real-time score tracking.

**📌 Project Description**

This project recreates the iconic Pong game, where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen.
The ball speeds up over time, scores are tracked, and points are awarded when a player misses the ball.

The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, animation, collision detection, and game mechanics using Python.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* Python 3
* Turtle Graphics
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Time module

**📂 Project Structure**

    main.py        # Main game loop and controls
    paddle.py     # Paddle movement logic
    ball.py       # Ball movement and collision handling
    scoreboard.py # Score tracking and display

**▶️ How It Works**

1. The game window opens with a black background
2. Two paddles are placed on the left and right sides
3. Controls:
* Right Paddle → ⬆️ Up / ⬇️ Down
* Left Paddle → W / S
4. The ball moves continuously across the screen
5. The ball:
* Bounces off the top and bottom walls
* Bounces off paddles and increases speed
6. A point is awarded when a player misses the ball
7. Scores are displayed at the top of the screen

**🎮 Gameplay Example**

    Left Player Score: 3
    Right Player Score: 5

**🎯 What I Learned**

* Implementing OOP with multiple classes
* Creating smooth animations using Turtle
* Handling keyboard input
* Detecting collisions with walls and paddles
* Managing real-time score updates
* Structuring a game into reusable modules

---
**🚀 Future Improvements**

* Add winning score limit
* Add sound effects
* Add pause and restart options
* Improve paddle and ball physics
* Add single-player mode with AI paddle
